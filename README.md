## Project Name: Pizza Hut
## Project Description:
This is a simple web development project created using HTML and CSS, with a focus on learning and applying Flexbox. The primary objective of this project was to implement the fundamental concepts and techniques I have studied over the past few weeks.
## Note:
The website is not responsive. My display resolution is 1280 x 720 (HD) pixels, so I designed this webpage based on my screen. For the best viewing experience, please resize your browser window to match this resolution.

## What I newly learned while building this project:
### 1. font-weight value:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bac4a57-5e0a-4f03-849e-f1f179feeca0)     
These values are helpful when I use Figma to analyze and replicate the design in my projects.

### 2. Figma visualizes padding as shown below:

- Left + right = 32
- Top + bottom = 21

### 3. Setting Google fonts:
#### Way 1:
- add the specific font links in the HTML <head> section before the style.css link and also add the particular cs font links to CSS file

#### Way 2:
  - add the specific font links on the top of the CSS file and remove the <style> tag.

  - Add a font name and a font weight for the CSS code.

### 4. Setting Font Awesome:
  - Collectkit a kit from the font Awesome website and paste the kit <script> tag in the <head> section above the style.css link

### 5. Using IMGBD to upload images:
  - If the images are not shown on the GitHub live site Use IMGBD to upload the images and use the provided link in src attribute in the <img> tag.
